# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The first step is to define the goal which is to find the relationship between launched date and campaign outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled). And then break down the data using function YEAR function, and visualize the data by creating a pivot table and line chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The first step is to define the goal which is to find the relationship between funding goal amount and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays. And then break down the data by goal amount and percentage of outcomes, and last visualize the data by creating a line chart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There are two new excel function used in this assignment, YEAR and COUNTIFS. The hint is really helpful. I have trouble uploading picture in README.md, so I watched a youtube video regarding how to add picture in the README.md. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

--The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in theater is May.

--May, June, July, August and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched in theaters.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

--The goal between 1000 to 4999 has the most successful outcomes for Kickstarter campaigns for plays.  

--The goal less than 1000 has the highest percentage of successful outcomes in the subcategory of plays. However, 45000-49999 has the lowest percentage of successful outcomes

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are missing values in this dataset

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can also use a column chart.
